# Recycraft

## About : 
Waste is one of the most complex problems in many countries, including Indonesia. In this country, one of the problems in waste management is that landfills are on the verge of overcapacity. Based on Indonesia’s SIPSN (Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional), in 2021, 53,48% of the overall waste in Indonesia is inorganic scraps, which means that there is a lot of waste that we can reduce, reuse, and recycle. This happens because many people have not been educated about how they can utilize these kinds of inorganic scraps. What can we do to reduce the amount of waste thrown away? What makes people in Indonesia have little knowledge about waste minimization? What can we do to improve people’s knowledge about recycling inorganic scraps? This project aims to educate people about these kinds of scraps and how they can utilize them. In this project, we will make an application that determines what the scraps or unused material is using machine learning, shows its information, gives a list of what handicrafts can be made from the material, and how to make them.
